# Objective

This Flutter project demonstrate the use of a clean architecture to build a very basic mobile app.

The app is built mostly with pure Dart and a bit of Flutter for the UI.

Users can use this app as a reference to strengthen their skills around designing apps with a clean architecture and wirting code using the SOLID design principles.

# Structure

- One Screen.
- One button.
- One placeholder for cat images.

# Workflow

- App launches.
- User presses the button.
- A call is made to the random cats API.
- A loading indicator is shown while the call is performed.
- A cat picture is displayed in the screen when the response is successful.
- If no connection we show an error message.
